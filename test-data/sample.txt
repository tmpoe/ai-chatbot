This is a sample document about AI and MCP.

MCP (Model Context Protocol) allows AI assistants to access external tools and data sources.

With MCP, your chatbot can:
- Read files from your filesystem
- Query databases
- Access APIs
- Control other applications

This makes AI assistants much more powerful and useful!
